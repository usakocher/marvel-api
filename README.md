# marvel-api

## Requirements
We wer tasked to build a web app using Flask, that allowed a user to register and sign in. The app also was to include API routes to the database.

## Assumptions
The assumptions made was that there was probably going to be more functionality beyond the point we were required to go.

## Method
Using Flask, I created my app with blueprints and routes. I also used Flask Forms and certain user management packages. The website allows users to 
register, sign in, and upload a character. When signed in, a user can see their email and token on the Account page, as well as all the characters they've
uploaded. A user can also upload a character with the 'Upload' page. Accounts and Upload are not available if a user is not signed in.

## Lessons Learned
This project was really exciting as it was the first website we officially deployed. It's a pretty involved process but working through it, especially after
the debug project, helped me understand more of what was actually happening. Customizing the forms and adding an upload form was a good experience in adapting
learned knowledge into a new exercise.
